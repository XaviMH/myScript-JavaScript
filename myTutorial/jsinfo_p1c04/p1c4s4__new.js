  SUMMARY

  To sum up:
    - Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but thereâ€™s 
      a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.
    - Constructor functions should only be called using new. Such a call implies a creation
      of empty this at the start and returning the populated one at the end.

  We can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.

  JavaScript provides constructor functions for many built-in language objects: like Date 
  for dates, Set for sets and others that we plan to study.

*/

/* Theory 1 

  The regular {...} syntax allows us to create one object. But often we need to create many 
  similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.

  That can be done using constructor functions and the "new" operator.
  
  Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:
    - They are named with capital letter first.
    - They should be executed only with "new" operator.
